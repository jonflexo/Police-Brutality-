    <h1> Police Brutality in the United States</h1>
    <p>Police brutality is the excessive and unwarranted use of force by law enforcement. It is an extreme form of police misconduct or violence and is a civil rights violation. It also refers to a situation where officers exercise undue or excessive force against a person. Police violence includes but is not limited to physical or verbal harassment, physical or mental injury, property damage, inaction of police officers, and in some cases, death.</p>
    <h2>Why Police Brutality Is An Issue</h2>
    <p>Police officers are not inherently bad people, but the ones that abuse their power can cause huge problems for everyone. The issue of police brutality is something that has been brought up a lot in the past year. But problems in the way we deal with crime have been going on for longer than that. There is something seriously wrong with our justice system.</p>
